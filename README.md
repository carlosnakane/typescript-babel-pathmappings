# Typescript + Babel + Path Mappings

> How to setup a typescript project using babel as transpiler (Path Mappings working in VSCODE, Jest and Webpack)

Yes, Typescript and Babel is a perfect marriage. They are powerfull tools and last year both 2 teams worked together and their efforts made possible the following workflow:
1. Typecheck with TSC;
2. Transpile with Babel;

And if you are using Webpack you can typechecking and transpile at same time thanks to `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` and `babel-loader`

## But...
I experienced some issues. Not big deal. But this one made me crazy.

### Typescript + Babel + Path Mappings...

Typescript path mapping is a great way to make your code cleaner.
Things like:
```
import { sum, multiply } from "../../../../../util/math";
```
becomes: 
```
import { sum, multiply } from "@util/math";
```

much better ðŸ˜ƒ

But it seems that `@babel/preset-typescript` still don't know how to deal with this typescript feature.

Today (July 2019) you can deal with this issue by adding and configuring the `babel-plugin-module-resolver` plugin to your project. And.. that's it! you are in the game again.

Check these files to know how to proppelly configure your Typescript + Babel (plus path mappings) project
* jest.config.js
* tsconfig.json
* .babelrc

## Scripts
* `npm run check-types` *check your code against tsconfig rules*
* `npm test` *test your code with Jest*
* `npm run build` *build your project with webpack. It wont emit TS definitions*
* `npm run build:types` *Emit TS definitions*
